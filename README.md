# Playground Website Project

Welcome to the Playground Website Project! This project aims to create an interactive React-NodeJs-SocketIO application featuring a variety of games to enjoy with friends.

## Current Status

## Technologies Used

- React
- Node.js
- Socket.IO

## How to Get Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using the package manager of your choice (e.g., npm or yarn).
4. Run the development server to explore the Wordle game or any other features in progress.

## Planned Features
